# Object Location Representations



This repository contains the analysis code that goes with the manuscript "The spatiotemporal neural dynamics of object location representations in the human brain". We also provide one demo dataset for EEG and fMRI data to run the code.

The EEG dataset consists of preprocessed EEG data of one subject, sorted by the 48 stimulus conditions. The fMRI dataset consists of the t-value vectors for each ROI of one subject, sorted by the 48 stimulus conditions.

All analyses were conducted using Matlab 2018b and were also tested on Matlab2016a and Matlab2020b. Additionally, it has been tested on the following operating systems: CentOS Linux, MacOS Big Sur version 11.1, Windows 10.

The code depends on functions from the libsvm-3.11 toolbox, which are provided in the folder /Code/LibsvmFunctions, thus no installation of the toolbox is required.
