# Object Location Representations



This repository contains the analysis code that goes with the manuscript "The spatiotemporal neural dynamics of object location representations in the human brain". 

All analyses were conducted using Matlab 2018b and were also tested on Matlab2016a and Matlab2020b. Additionally, it has been tested on the following operating systems: CentOS Linux, MacOS Big Sur version 11.1, Windows 10.

The code depends on functions from the libsvm-3.11 toolbox, which are provided in the folder /Code/LibsvmFunctions, thus no installation of the toolbox is required.
